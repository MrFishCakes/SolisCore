# SolisMC Core
What is this? Well during the COVID-19 pandemic I became very bored and started to write this plugin. Is is a test of what I was able to do and I aim to do many things with this project. Some dependencies are used within this but I will list these below and any files that were used within the code will be clearly documented with either a provided header from the source or a link to the original file. This might even make the portfolio.

This project follows the *Major.Minor.Patch* versioning.


## Dependencies Used

[**LightningStorage** - JavaFactory](https://github.com/JavaFactoryDev/LightningStorage)

## TODO List

 - Custom plugin class
 - Custom configurations
 - User management
 - Punishments

I will add more to this list as we progress through with the plugin
